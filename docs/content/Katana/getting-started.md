Katana is a cutting-edge Attack-Defense Capture the Flag (CTF) platform built. CTF is a popular cybersecurity competition where participants compete against each other by solving complex challenges related to cybersecurity. Katana makes it possible for users to easily host and play CTF competitions in a secure and scalable environment.

One of the most notable features of Katana is its use of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, Katana is able to provide a highly scalable and resilient platform that can handle a large number of users and high volumes of traffic.

The platform also provides a dashboard for managing competitions. The dashboard allows users to manage the challenges, teams, and scoring for the competition. It also provides real-time statistics and monitoring of the competition, enabling the organizers to make adjustments as needed.

Katana's use of Kubernetes also ensures that the platform is highly secure. Kubernetes provides a variety of security features that are designed to protect against attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and data breaches. These features include role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, and pod security policies. Additionally, Kubernetes provides automated security updates, ensuring that the platform is always up-to-date with the latest security patches.
